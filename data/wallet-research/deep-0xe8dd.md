```

**Conclusion:** `CONVICTION BUYER - mostly holds to resolve`

## Win Rate Verification

```
=== REAL WIN RATE ===
Wins: 0, Losses: 0, Pending: 50
WIN RATE: 0.0% (0/0)
```

**Status:** All sampled positions (50 markets checked) are **still pending** - no resolved markets yet.

**The claimed 100% WR cannot be verified** because:
1. All positions are still open (pending)
2. Trading activity is brand new (single day)
3. No historical resolved positions found

## Red Flags 🚩

1. **Discrepancy in trade count:** API shows 1000 trades (not 695 as claimed)
2. **Sport mismatch:** Zero NBA/NHL/CS2 trades (claimed to be primary focus)
3. **All trades in "other" category**
4. **All trades same day:** Suspicious burst activity
5. **No resolved positions:** Cannot verify any win rate
6. **100% WR claim is FALSE** - zero verifiable wins

## Verdict

**NOT A LEGITIMATE 100% WR TRADER**

This wallet shows:
- Brand new activity (single day)
- No verifiable wins (all pending)
- Sport category mismatch with original claim
- Likely a bot or bulk position opener
- Cannot be considered a "winning trader" to copy

**Recommendation:** ❌ **DO NOT COPY** - No track record, unverified claims, suspicious activity pattern
