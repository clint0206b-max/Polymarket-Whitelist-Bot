  "recommendations": [
    "ALL esports markets on Polymarket currently have very low liquidity (<$10K typically)",
    "Esports markets are poor targets for wallet analysis compared to political markets",
    "Contact Polymarket support or check developer docs for sports API endpoints",
    "Monitor major tournaments (VCT Champions, CS2 Majors, LoL Worlds) for potentially higher volume",
    "Consider focusing on political/crypto markets instead where volume is 10-100x higher"
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "Check if other esports (CS2, LoL, Dota2) have markets with sufficient volume",
    "Try browser automation to extract condition IDs from the sports page",
    "Look for Polymarket GraphQL or alternative API endpoints for sports data",
    "Monitor VCT Champions or Masters tournaments for higher-volume markets"
  ],
  "methodology_notes": "Attempted multiple API endpoints and search strategies. Confirmed markets exist via web interface but could not programmatically access trade data due to API limitations and low market volumes making traditional wallet analysis impractical."
